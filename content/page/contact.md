I am currently accepting commissions for small oil paintings.  
If you have photographs of pets, people, landscapes, or anything else you would like to have painted, I can use them as references. If not, I will ask you for your preferred subject matter and paint from that.  
It takes approximately one month from order receipt to delivery.
